cifX-Toolkit Version History:
=============================

Known Problems:
 - Automatic file upload for PCI hardware not implemented

V1.1.2.0
-----------------
 - Added notification callback for COM flag state

V1.1.1.0
-----------------
 - Added command packet to set the device time during hardware startup, if a RTC is aveilable
 - Added MRAM API functions

V1.1.0.0
-----------------
 - Fix: Lock DEV_DoSystemStart() againt DSR to prevent writes to handshake flags while in reset, if an IRQ occurs
 - Fix: DEV_DoSystemStart() now clears internal COS Flags in Interrupt mode
 - Updated unsigned long data types to uint32_t
 - New header file added to separate declarations for cifX hardware functions from cifXToolkit.h
 - Added Hardware interface layer (supports serial DPM access e.g. via SPI, RDY/BSY DPM workaround)
 - Added optional validation of pointers and handles passed to toolkit functions (CIFX_TOOLKIT_PARAMETER_CHECK)
 - Added Debug Trace output of device information (DevNr/SerialNr/SlotNr)
 - Added eCIFX_DEVICE_DONT_TOUCH device type to use cards without any changes
 - Added xSysdeviceBootstart() / DEV_DoSystemBootstart() function to switch into bootloader mode

V1.0.4.0
-----------------
 - Starting automatically downloaded configuration database may fail for flash based devices

V1.0.3.0
-----------------
 - Handshake Flags may get out of synch when doing a system start in interrupt mode, if
   firmware asserts interrupt at unexpected time
 - Module downloading to flash / starting from flash may timeout when for large modules

V1.0.2.0
-----------------
 - xChannelDMAState() comments fixed
 - netJACK 100 added to PCI definitions header file
 - ChannelDemo() / xChannelIOWrite() uses now abSendData[] instead of abRecvData[]
 - cifXCreateChannels(), fixed memory leak if channel was not created
 - xSysdeviceReset() / xChannelReset(CIFX_SYSTEMSTART) may leave COS flags in invalid
   state in interrupt mode (influences loadable modules)

V1.0.1.0
-----------------
 - DSR Handler crashes due to invalid access on a communication channel instance
 - xSysdeviceReset is now locked against ISR/DSR or Cyclic Thread. Earlier versions
   may write invalid handshake flags during a system start if the cyclic thread or IRQ
   accesses the flags during this time.
 - Downloading loadable modules (.NXO) may fail on larger files due to the last 
   confirmation packet taking longer than expected

V1.0.0.0
-----------------
 - xChannelSyncState parameters updated (added Timeout)
 - SyncState Error codes added
 - Loadable modules may not work (depends on implementation of OS_Strncpy)
 - Fixed GCC compiler warning (deferencing pointer breaks strict-aliasing rules)
 - If start of Firmware fails (e.g. wrong HW options) the card will not
   be rejected by toolkit. It will be used as a card with a system device only.
 - xChannelPLCMemoryPointer may not working correctly due to an invalid parameter 
   passed to OS_MapUserPointer / UnmapUserPointer
 - GetMDRequest may fail depending on the implementation of OS_Strncpy
 - xChannelPLCActivateRead / Write did not lock access to handshake flags
 - cifXHandleWarmstart() using same buffer for send/receive in TransferPacket() fixed
 - DEV_DeleteFile(), OS_Strncpy() size of copied data must include the necessary 0 character
 - DEV_Download() uses twice the packet timeout (=10s) for the last packet if modules are loaded
 
V0.10.1.0
--------------------------
 - Interrupt mode may miss first interrupt after initialization, due to readout 
   of sync handshake flags

V0.10.0.0
--------------------------
 - Functions for SyncMode added
 - Interrupt Handling changed to support notification callbacks for user (xChannelRegisterNotification)

 - xChannelBusState(), COM_FLAG handling in conjunction with
   timeout settings fixed/improved

   USER_GetBootloader can check if a bootloader for a netX50 or netX100/500
   is requested.

 - Signalling interrupts from DSR changed, so that systems 
   that may get interrupted during DSR are working
 - DSRhandler changed to signal netX Handshake bit changes (since previous irq)
   instead of Host/Netx flag differences. This allows DEV_WaitForBitstate_Irq

10.07.2007
 - cifX Test crashed, if no device was selected in dialog
03.05.2007
 - On DPM based devices a the driver always creates a communication channel. Even without a firmware.
   This can lead into blue screen if such a channel is access from a user application. 
26.04.2007
